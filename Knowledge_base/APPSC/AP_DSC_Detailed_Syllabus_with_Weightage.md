## ðŸ§  Highâ€‘Yield Strategy (by Weightage)

- **Subject Content (SA/LP):** ~**55â€“60%** of marks; **Pedagogy/Methodology** ~**20%** â€” secure these two first.  
- **SGT:** Pedagogy + Perspectives together ~**30%**; then split time equally across **Math / Science / Social / Languages**.  
- **PE streams:** Largest chunk = **Rules & Officiating + Training Principles**; memorize signals, dimensions, faults, microâ€‘cycles/mesoâ€‘cycles.  
- **GK/CA:** Keep a weekly sheet for **APâ€‘specific schemes, education initiatives, & budgets**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Quick Prep Checklist

- [ ] **Map PYQs** to a topic tracker (Content vs Methodology vs GK/CA).  
- [ ] **Oneâ€‘pagers** for learning theories, assessment tools, inclusive ed.  
- [ ] **Math/Science/Social** formulae & concept maps (class VIâ€“X scope).  
- [ ] **Language**: daily comprehension + grammar edits + pedagogy MCQs.  
- [ ] **PE**: rules/officiating tables; training principles; anatomy & firstâ€‘aid.  
- [ ] 10â€“12 fullâ€‘length mocks; analyze error patterns; adjust weak topics.

## ðŸ”Ž Notes & Variations to Watch
- Residential society posts (APMS/APREIS/MJPAPBCWREIS/Tribal Welfare) may **add instituteâ€‘specific components** or vary content depth.  
- Some notifications prescribe **No negative marking**; confirm before mocks.  
- **Medium & language options** for Language posts: verify exact combinations & eligibility.
